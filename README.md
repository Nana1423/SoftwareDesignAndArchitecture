# Software Design And Architecture
This repository owns the projects and exercises from the course: Software Design and Architecture from the University of Alberta. 

In the Software Design and Architecture Specialization, you will learn how to apply design principles, patterns, and architectures to create reusable and flexible software applications and systems. You will learn how to express and document the design and architecture of a software system using a visual notation.

## Course #1: Object Oriented Design

This course takes Java beginners to the next level by covering object-oriented analysis and design. You will discover how to create modular, flexible, and reusable software, by applying object-oriented design principles and guidelines. And, you will be able to communicate these designs in a visual notation known as Unified Modelling Language (UML).

Skills developed on this course:

* Object-Oriented Design
* Object-Oriented Analysis And Design
* Unified Modeling Language (UML)

Certificate: 

## Course #2: Design Pattern

This course extends object-oriented analysis and design by incorporating design patterns to create interactive applications. Through a survey of established design patterns, you will gain a foundation for more complex software applications. Finally, you will identify problematic software designs by referencing a catalog of code smells.

Skills developed on this course: 

* Demonstrate how to use design patterns to address user interface design issues
* Identify the most suitable design pattern to address a given application design problem
* Apply design principles (e.g., open-closed, dependency inversion, least knowledge)
* Critique code by identifying and refactoring anti-patterns
* Apply the model-view-controller architectural pattern
